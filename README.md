What does this extensions

- switch current gtk2/3, cursor, icons and shell theme to ADWAITA default and viceversa




TODDO list:
- popup on hover to show current themes settings

and 2 buttons

1)  go to adwaita default
2)  set my custom themes

- if theme changes eg using gnome tweak tool the extension should use current custom setting
  ( no  use themes defined on first start of extension and it is no able to detect changes in theme settings)
